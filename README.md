# Railway-Management-System

This project will focus on the process of train ticket booking and personalized user experience for their travel.
The following process will take place on the portal for a potential customer:

• The first screen will be a simple GUI showing three functions, viz., book a ticket, search for a reservation, and cancel a reservation.

• When the user clicks on the button to book a ticket, a set of text boxes appear in which the user enters relevant details.

• Once the user submits the information, the details are stored in the passenger table.

• When the user wants to search for a booking, just by clicking the Search Booking button they can access a record by entering the reservation number (which is the primary key for the passenger table)

• When the user wants to cancel a booking, just by clicking the Cancel Booking button they can cancel their reservation by entering the reservation number. The record is then taken off the table.

Here's what you need to run this successfully - 
Python 2.7 - run the python file.
XAMPP - this is the software to create the database the python file will connect to.
